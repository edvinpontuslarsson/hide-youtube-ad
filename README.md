# Hide YouTube Side Panel Ad

## Description

This Firefox extension is designed to enhance the user experience on YouTube by selectively hiding the side panel advertisement. It targets the HTML element with the ID `secondary`, which is known to display image ads on YouTube pages. 

While other extensions may offer video ad-blocking capabilities, this extension specifically addresses the side panel ads that some ad-blockers do not cover.

## Installation

This extension is currently not public and therefore needs to be self-hosted.

The installation process for this extension may vary depending on your Firefox version and operating system. 

I would recommend consulting chatGPT for instructions to add it to your Firefox and/or using a trial-and-error-approach.
