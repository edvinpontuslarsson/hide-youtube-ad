# Hide YouTube Side Panel Ad

## Description

This Firefox extension is designed to enhance the user experience on YouTube by selectively hiding the side panel advertisement. It targets the HTML element with the ID `secondary`, which is known to display image ads on YouTube pages. 

While other extensions may offer video ad-blocking capabilities, this extension specifically addresses the side panel ads that some ad-blockers do not cover.

## Installation

This extension is currently not public and therefore needs to be self-hosted.

The installation process for this extension may vary depending on your Firefox version and operating system. 

I would recommend consulting chatGPT for instructions to add it to your Firefox and/or using a trial-and-error-approach.

## An approach that might work

### Step 1: Download the Extension

1. Download the latest version of the extension from the releases section.
2. Save the `.xpi` file to a known location on your computer.

### Step 2: Install the Extension

1. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:addons`.
2. Click on the gear icon (⚙️) at the top of the page to open the Add-ons Manager menu.
3. Choose 'Install Add-on From File...' from the menu.
4. Navigate to the location where you saved the `.xpi` file, select it, and click 'Open'.
5. Firefox will ask you to confirm that you want to install the add-on. Confirm the prompt to proceed with the installation.

### Step 3: Enjoy the Extension

After installation, visit YouTube and enjoy an enhanced viewing experience without the sidebar. The extension will automatically hide the "secondary" sidebar on all YouTube pages.
